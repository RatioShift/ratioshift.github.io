                <p class="lead">I’ve officially started the <strong>Complete Web Development Bootcamp</strong> with Programming Hero. This isn't just a course; it's a mission to master the MERN stack.</p>
                
                <p>The curriculum is structured into <strong>Milestones</strong>. Each milestone feels like a level in a game—you finish the modules, complete the assignment, and "level up." Below, I am organizing my personal study notes. If you are a fellow student, feel free to use these as a reference!</p>

                <h3>My Opinion So Far</h3>
                <p>Programming Hero stands out because of its <strong>Support System</strong>. Whenever I get stuck on a CSS bug or a JavaScript logic error, the 24/7 support sessions are a lifesaver. The videos are fun, engaging, and break down complex topics into "human-readable" language.</p>

                <p class="lead">They say the best way to predict the future is to create it. That’s why I finally took the leap and joined the <strong>Web Development Bootcamp with Programming Hero</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>If you're in the tech community, you've probably heard of <strong>Jhankar Mahbub</strong> and his "crazy" level of support system. After following their content for a while, I decided to become a formal student. The course is intense, structured, and designed to take you from absolute zero to a professional developer in 6 months.</p>

                <h3>The Structure: Milestones & Modules</h3>
                <p>What I love most about this bootcamp is how it’s organized. It’s not just a random list of videos. It’s divided into <strong>Milestones</strong>, and each milestone contains several <strong>Modules</strong>. This "reward-based" system keeps you motivated—you can't just skip ahead; you have to earn your progress.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <strong>Current Status:</strong> I am currently in the middle of the journey! This means some of my notes are still "Coming Soon" as I unlock new milestones.
                </div>

                <h3>Why I am building this "Notebook"</h3>
                <p>As a student, the amount of information is massive. To stay organized, I started creating detailed notes in Google Docs for every module I complete. I realized that these notes could help others too. Whether you are a fellow student or someone curious about the curriculum, you are welcome to use my resources.</p>

                <h3>My Personal Learning Vault</h3>
                <p>Below, you will find links to my personal Google Docs. I have shared them as <strong>View-Only</strong>. If you want to keep a copy for yourself, simply go to <code>File > Make a copy</code> or <code>Download</code> within the Doc.</p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Joining <strong>Programming Hero</strong> isn't just about learning to code; it's about learning <strong>discipline</strong>. The 11:59 PM deadlines for assignments are real, and the 24/7 support system is a lifesaver. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
